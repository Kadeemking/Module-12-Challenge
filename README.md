# SQL Employee Tracker

## Description

I wanted to build a command-line application designed to help businesses efficiently manage their employee records, roles, and departments. This application is important for businesses seeking to manage their workforce data. 

Building this project helped me understand how to utilize node.js and postgresSQL better. It also gave me more practice with using the inquirer library.
